A simple blogging system using PHP and MySQL.


Basic Overview
==============

This project can be forked by anyone who knows or is in phase of learnig 
PHP and is trying to figure out how a login and a blogger can be 
implemented.<br/>

#### Users

Consists of a login sytem.<br/>
This project uses user and login tables in blog db.<br/>
(Whole of the mysql code is available in blog.sql)<br/>

#### Blogs

Blogs (from db) are fetched and displayed, at home page.<br/>
After creating an account, new blogs can be written.<br/>
Each blog reserves special privelages for editing and deletion.<br/> 


How to run this project on your machine
=======================================

Unfortunately, documentation is a bit sparse at the moment (I 
gladly accept contributions).<br/>
The project is well-structured, and you need to do is <br/>
1. Open phpmyadmin.<br/>
2. Make new db with name 'blog'.<br/>
3. Import the file blog.sql.<br/>
4. Run the localhost apache server.<br/>
5. Open /blog directory, to view index page.<br/>
